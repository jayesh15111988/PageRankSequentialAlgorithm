CONTENTS OF PACKAGE 1_Project1P1:

The package contains four files,
-pagerank.java : The source code for the project
-pagerank.class : The executable class file built from the same code
-README.txt : The README file to describe how to run rank.class
-Group1_Report.docx : The technical report for the project
-pagerank_output.txt : The output file that contains the top 10 ranking url numbers for 10 iterations with input file pagerank.input.1000.9




TO RUN THE PROGRAM:

The project can be executed by directly running the executable rank.class file in command line. The command line arguments have to be given in the following order :

java [input file name] [output file name] [number of iterations] [damping factor]

NOTE: 
-Ensure that the number of iterations given is a positive integer or 0. If number of iterations is zero, the program will calculate the PageRank values
till the values converge.
-The damping factor should be a number between 0 and 1.
